defmodule ParseAddress do
  @moduledoc """
  ParseAddress is a regex-based street address and street intersection parser for the United States. Its
  basic goal is to be as forgiving as possible when parsing user-provided address strings. ParseAddress
  knows about directional prefixes and suffixes, fractional building numbers, building units, grid-based
  addresses (such as those used in parts of Utah), 5 and 9 digit ZIP codes, and all of the official USPS
  abbreviations for street types, state names and secondary unit designators.

  Parses any address or intersection string and returns the appropriate specifier.

  Relies on individual implementations for different country groups. Currently only supports
  the United States (:us)
